SQL QUERIES: 

select * from CustomerData1;

-- 1.Understanding the overall churn rate of the company: 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalCustomers,
       SUM(CASE WHEN UPPER(Cleaned_Churn) = 'YES' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ChurnedCustomers,
       (SUM(CASE WHEN UPPER(Cleaned_Churn) = 'YES' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0) / COUNT(*) AS ChurnRate
FROM CustomerData1;

-- This shows that 1869 customers, left the company out of 7043, which is 26.53% of the total customers. 

---2 Finding factors most strongly associated with churn: 
WITH ChurnFactors AS (
    SELECT customerID,
           MonthlyCharges,
           tenure,
           Cleaned_Churn,
           CASE 
               WHEN MonthlyCharges > 50 THEN 'High Spend'
               WHEN MonthlyCharges BETWEEN 30 AND 50 THEN 'Medium Spend'
               ELSE 'Low Spend'
           END AS SpendCategory,
            TechSupport
    FROM CustomerData1
)
SELECT SpendCategory,
         TechSupport, 
       COUNT(*) AS TotalCustomers,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Cleaned_Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ChurnedCustomers,
       (SUM(CASE WHEN Cleaned_Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0) / COUNT(*) AS ChurnRate
FROM ChurnFactors
GROUP BY SpendCategory,TechSupport
ORDER BY ChurnRate DESC;


---3. What are the monthly charges for each contract type, and which type contributes the most revenue?

WITH RevenueByContract AS (
    SELECT Contract,
           SUM(MonthlyCharges) AS TotalRevenue,
           AVG(MonthlyCharges) AS AverageMonthlyCharges
    FROM CustomerData1
    GROUP BY Contract
)
SELECT Contract, 
       TotalRevenue, 
       AverageMonthlyCharges,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC) AS RevenueRank
FROM RevenueByContract
ORDER BY RevenueRank;


-- 4.How does tenure impact churn and monthly charges?

WITH TenureAnalysis AS (
    SELECT tenure,
           COUNT(*) AS TotalCustomers,
           SUM(CASE WHEN Cleaned_Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ChurnedCustomers,
           AVG(MonthlyCharges) AS AverageMonthlyCharges
    FROM CustomerData1
    GROUP BY tenure
)
SELECT tenure,
       TotalCustomers,
       ChurnedCustomers,
       (ChurnedCustomers * 100.0) / TotalCustomers AS ChurnRate,
       AverageMonthlyCharges
FROM TenureAnalysis
ORDER BY tenure;

--This shows the customers having longer tenure, correlates with lower churn and higher monthly charges. 

-- 5. Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by Contract Type
---Insight: The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) helps understand how much revenue each customer segment is likely to generate over their lifetime, providing insights for retention strategies.

WITH CustomerCLV AS (
    SELECT customerID,
           MonthlyCharges * tenure AS CLV,
           Contract
    FROM CustomerData1
)
SELECT Contract,
       SUM(CLV) AS TotalCLV,
       AVG(CLV) AS AverageCLV
FROM CustomerCLV
GROUP BY Contract
ORDER BY TotalCLV DESC;

--- From calculating customer lifetime value we understand that, contract of Two year are more valuable in the longer term. 

-- 6. Find the top 5 customers by monthly charges, and display their churn status

WITH RankedCustomers AS (
    SELECT customerID,
           MonthlyCharges,
           Cleaned_Churn,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY MonthlyCharges DESC) AS Rank
    FROM CustomerData1
)
SELECT customerID, MonthlyCharges, Cleaned_Churn, Rank
FROM RankedCustomers
WHERE Rank <= 5
ORDER BY Rank;

--7. This query identifies high value customers and their churn status. 

WITH HighRiskCustomers AS (
    SELECT customerID,
           MonthlyCharges,
           tenure,
           Cleaned_Churn,
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY MonthlyCharges DESC, tenure ASC) AS RiskRank
    FROM CustomerData1
)
SELECT customerID, MonthlyCharges, tenure, Cleaned_Churn, RiskRank
FROM HighRiskCustomers
WHERE RiskRank <= 10 AND Cleaned_Churn = 'Yes'
ORDER BY RiskRank;
