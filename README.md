# Customer-Churn-

## Customer Churn Analysis with SQL

### Objective:
This project analyzes customer data to understand the factors affecting customer churn and provides insights for improving customer retention strategies. Using SQL, we explore the relationships between customer characteristics and churn rates.

### Technologies Used:
- SQL (for querying data)

### Data Source:
The dataset used contains customer demographics, service usage, and billing information. This project focuses on customer churn, lifetime value, and revenue segmentation based on contract types.

## Key Insights:
1. **Overall Churn Rate**: The companyâ€™s overall churn rate is approximately **26.53%**.
2. **Factors Associated with Churn**: **High spenders** tend to have lower churn rates, while **low spenders** exhibit higher churn rates, particularly when they lack access to key services (e.g., **TechSupport**).
3. **Revenue by Contract Type**: **Month-to-month contracts** contribute the most revenue but come with higher churn. **Two-year contracts** generate long-term value and show lower churn.
4. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: **Two-year contracts** provide the highest **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**, making them the most valuable contract type.
5. **Churn Prediction**: **High-value** customers with **short tenure** are at risk of churning, which indicates a need for **personalized retention strategies**.
